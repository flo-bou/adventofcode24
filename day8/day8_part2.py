# an antinode harmonic occurs at any grid position exactly in line with at least two antennas of the same frequency, regardless of distance
# This means that some of the new antinodes will occur at the position of each antenna (unless that antenna is the only one of its frequency). <- comprend pas l'énoncé.
# This means that some of the new antinodes will occur at the position of each antenna (unless that antenna is the only one of its frequency).
# continuer de faire des antinodes sur toute la droite + les pylones sont des antinodes
# How many unique locations within the bounds of the map contain an antinode?
